# Lab 3.3 - Developing with Bootstrap
- What challenges did you face when refactoring your code to use Bootstrap?
  <br>
  The biggest challenge was actually using bootstrap! In my humble, semi-professional opinion, I severely underestimated the learning curve on bootstrap. There was many frustrating moments I had when implementing bootstrap into elements like buttons and getting it to the size I wanted. Maybe if I play around with bootstrap more and gain more experience with it, I wouldn't feel restricted to the few customizations that actually worked out for me.
- How did using Bootstrap utility classes and components simplify your styling process?
  <br>
  I do believe utilizing bootstrap when making a website would make the process a lot more simple and efficient as you would have to switch from the html and css pages a lot less. Bootstrap is supposed to make the styling process a lot more seamless. However, during my own experiences working with it, I must reiterate that I will need to play around with Bootstrap more to truly feel the benefits of it as I am too used to building CSS from scratch.
- In what scenarios might you choose not to use Bootstrap and write custom CSS instead?
  <br>
  Like I mentioned earlier, I felt very restricted while using Bootstrap. At least according to the Bootstrap library, it only showcased very few styles of elements and colors, and as someone who has always used CSS as a way of creative expression, I personally would like to have a lot more freedom in customization. However, it does give the user a great skeleton to work with, but if I wanted to make a container or button a soft pink color, I'd rather use custom CSS instead.
